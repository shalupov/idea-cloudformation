Moving on
---------

AWS CloudFormation plugin moves to IntelliJ IDEA repository and generally will be supported by JetBrains.
Source code is available at https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-plugins/tree/master/CloudFormation

Please file issues at https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newIssue?project=IDEAc=Subsystem%20Lang.%20CloudFormation

For plugin users almost nothing will change, the plugin will be still available from Plugin Repository.

Thank you for your support all these years
